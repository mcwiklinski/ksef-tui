# KSeF

KSeF client project currently centered on a Terminal UI, with a Rails Web UI being rebuilt and expanded.

## Project Status

- Terminal UI based on RatatuiRuby for previewing invoices
- Rails Web UI is in progress and will become a first-class interface.
- Core KSeF client/domain logic is shared so both interfaces can evolve together.

## Current Capabilities (TUI)

- Token-based authentication with KSeF API.
- Interactive invoice list and detail view.
- Debug/API inspection views.
- Profile-based configuration from `~/.ksef.yml`.

## Current Capabilities (Web)

- Profile-based sign-in and session handling.
- Invoice list and invoice detail pages.
- XML download for invoice source documents.
- Browser-side PDF generation from invoice XML on the invoice detail page.
- Invoice item summaries on the invoice list, with CSV export reuse.

## Web PDF Notes

- The PDF download button in the web UI uses the official KSeF browser-side generator.
- The generated bundle is vendored in `vendor/javascript/ksef_pdf_generator.js` and pinned through importmap.
- No extra JavaScript build step is required in app development to use this PDF feature.

## Requirements

- Ruby 4.0.1 
- Access to KSeF API credentials (NIP + token).

## Configuration

Create `~/.ksef.yml`:

```yaml
settings:
  locale: "en"
  default_host: "api.ksef.mf.gov.pl"
  max_retries: 3
  open_timeout: 10
  read_timeout: 15
  write_timeout: 10

default_profile: "Production"
profiles:
  - name: "Production"
    nip: "1111111111"
    token: "prod-token"
  - name: "Test"
    nip: "2222222222"
    token: "test-token"
    host: "api-test.ksef.mf.gov.pl"
```

For OpenAI-powered invoice item summaries in the web UI and CSV export, you can either export the variables in your shell or create a local `.env` file. The app loads `.env.local` first and then `.env`, without overwriting variables that are already set in the environment.

Example `.env`:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5.4-mini"
```

or as plain key/value entries in `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini
```

You can start from `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If either variable is missing, the app falls back to a deterministic summary derived from the invoice item descriptions.

## Run TUI

From project root:

```bash
rake tui
```

You can also pass profile:

```bash
rake "tui[Test]"
```

or:

```bash
PROFILE=Test rake tui
```

If your shell does not auto-activate bundle context, use `bundle exec rake tui`.
